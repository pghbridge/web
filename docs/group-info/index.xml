Pittsburgh Bridge welcomes everyone 18 years of age or older regardless of experience level, providing you are accepting and respectful of all of our members.

      <description>By attending Bridge events or making use of Bridge resources, individuals agree to adhere to the following guidelines:
Treat other attendees with respect and courtesy. Anyone engaging in rude or disruptive behavior will be warned. If the behavior continues, the person may be asked to leave and not attend further Pittsburgh Bridge events.
Most Bridge events are held in public restaurants. These venues welcome the kink community, but there are acceptable levels of dress and behavior that we must maintain.</description>
