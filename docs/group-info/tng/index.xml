      <description>Sloshes are booze-centric shindigs. Drink, eat, and be merry in a low key social environment. Itâ€™s a bit wilder than a munch, but not quite as intense as a happy hour. You could consider it a cross between the two. Sloshes are designed for those in the 18-35 age demographic (and their partners) to have a relaxed atmosphere to connect with others and begin to explore kink.
TNG sloshes are usually held on the last Friday of the month and rotate between various bars and restaurants.</description>
