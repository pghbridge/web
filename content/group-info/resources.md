<h2>National Coalition for Sexual Freedom</h2>

[The NCSF](https://www.ncsfreedom.org) is committed to creating a political, legal and social environment in the US that advances equal rights for consenting adults who engage in alternative sexual and relationship expressions. The NCSF aims to advance the rights of, and advocate for consenting adults in the BDSM-Leather-Fetish, Swing, and Polyamory Communities. We pursue our vision through direct services, education, advocacy, and outreach, in conjunction with our partners, to directly benefit these communities.

[The Kink And Poly Aware Professionals Directory](https://www.kapprofessionals.org/) (KAP) is a service offered by NCSF dedicated to providing the community with a listing of psychotherapeutic, medical, legal and other professionals who have stated that they are knowledgeable about and sensitive to diverse expressions of sexuality.

<h2>Introductory Writings</h2>

These writings were put together by experienced kinkster and member of our leadership team roo-roo.  They cover common topics that are of particular interest to newcomers in our community.
