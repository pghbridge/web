<h2>Munches</h2>

Munches are social gatherings, which are generally held at restaurants. These are weeknight events which center around food, drink, and discussion with fellow kinksters. They offer a relaxed atmosphere and are an excellent way to meet people and begin to explore kink.

<h2>Happy Hour</h2>

If you’re not quite ready for a play event, but looking for something a little wilder than a munch, Happy Hours are the events for you. They’re held at a selection of bars across the city and generally include drinks, dancing, and a party atmosphere.

<h2>Sloshes</h2>

Sloshes are booze-centric shindigs. Drink, eat, and be merry in a low key social environment. It’s a bit wilder than a munch, but not quite as intense as a happy hour. You could consider it a cross between the two. Sloshes are designed for those in the 18-35 age demographic (and their partners) to have a relaxed atmosphere to connect with others and begin to explore kink.

<h2>Educational Events</h2>

Academy events are educational classes which focus on a variety of topics across the spectrum of kink. Speakers may include experienced members of the local community or nationally known presenters, and the presentation typically includes a live demonstration which illustrates the concepts being taught.
