Munches are social gatherings, which are generally held at restaurants. These are weeknight events which center around food, drink, and discussion with fellow kinksters. They offer a relaxed atmosphere and are an excellent way to meet people and begin to explore kink.


<h2>Pittsburgh Bridge Munch: Roland’s</h2>

7 p.m. on the first Tuesday of the month at [Roland’s Seafood Grill](https://www.rolandspittsburgh.com/) in the Strip District.

Roland’s is one of our favorite venues. It offers a large, private area upstairs with a deck, pool tables, a huge bar, a lounge, and all the space we need to stretch out. Downstairs, where This Generation Pittsburgh is held, is a smaller, comfortable space with a cozy fireplace. Summer or winter, Roland’s is a fantastic place to enjoy an evening with friends.

 
<h2>Pittsburgh Bridge Munch: The Big Bang</h2>

7 p.m. on the fourth Tuesday of the month at [The Big Bang](https://thebigbangbar.com/locations-page/pittsburgh) (formerly known as Sing-Sing) at the waterfront.

The place is usually closed to the public on Tuesdays, so when they open it’s a private event just for Pittsburgh Bridge!  The Big Bang features the same food and drink menu that you might know from the Rock Bottom restaurant and brewery, so there are plenty of great options!

 
<h2>Pittsburgh Bridge Bonus Munches</h2>

If there is a 5th Tuesday in a month, we will get together at 7 p.m. at a new location in the city that isn't part of our usual rotation.
