Munches are social gatherings, which are generally held at restaurants. These are weeknight events which center around food, drink, and discussion with fellow kinksters. They offer a relaxed atmosphere and are an excellent way to meet people and begin to explore kink.


<h2>Pittsburgh Bridge Munch: Roland’s</h2>

7 p.m. on the first Tuesday of the month at [Roland’s Seafood Grill](https://www.rolandspittsburgh.com/) in the Strip District.

Roland’s is one of our favorite venues. It offers a large, private area upstairs with a deck, pool tables, a huge bar, a lounge, and all the space we need to stretch out. Downstairs, where This Generation Pittsburgh is held, is a smaller, comfortable space with a cozy fireplace. Summer or winter, Roland’s is a fantastic place to enjoy an evening with friends.
