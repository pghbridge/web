If you’re not quite ready for a play event, but looking for something a little wilder than a munch, Happy Hours are the events for you. They’re held at a selection of bars across the city and generally include drinks, dancing, and a party atmosphere. Pittsburgh Bridge Happy Hour is held at 7 p.m. on the second or third Friday of the month at various bars around the city.

Pittsburgh Bridge frequents the following locations.

<h2>Tiki Lounge</h2>

The site of one of the earliest Pittsburgh Bridge Happy Hours, the Tiki Lounge features exotic flavorful drinks and a dance floor.

<h2>Squirrel Hill Sports Bar</h2>

The Squirrel Hill Sports Bar is a newer location for us that has already lead to some great times.  This location has a diverse menu, and lots of activities going on to share with your kinky friends – including pool, ping-pong, karaoke, and even chess.
