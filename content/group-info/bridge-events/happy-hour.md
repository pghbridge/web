If you’re not quite ready for a play event, but looking for something a little wilder than a munch, Happy Hours are the events for you. They’re held at a selection of bars across the city and generally include drinks, dancing, and a party atmosphere. Pittsburgh Bridge Happy Hour is held at 7 p.m. on the second or third Friday of the month at various bars around the city.
