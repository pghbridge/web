So you enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey, The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, and The Secretary a little more than you let on? You thought to yourself, I bet there’s more of this stuff out there. You browsed a bit and found kink, BDSM, and fetish websites by the dozen. You watched movies. You read stories. Maybe you even checked out a personal ad or two. Then you found us.

Pittsburgh Bridge is the gateway into the world you’ve been imagining. Are you ready to take the next step? Are you ready to meet others like you who are just beginning to explore this side of themselves? You’ve come to the right place. We offer a safe, friendly space to meet people who share your interests, classes that will help you learn things they don’t put in books, and everything else that you need to turn your fantasies into reality.
